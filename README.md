# Mini Robot 3D 
This oneâ€™s special. It's not just a static page â€” it's a blend of code, motion, and creative expression.

ðŸ¦¾ A responsive layout, 
âœ¨ Smooth UI interactions, 
ðŸ¤– A real-time 3D robot (thanks to Spline), 
ðŸ’¡ Subtle gradients and layered glow effects.

Building this helped me explore:
- How to embed 3D into real-world UIs
- Crafting immersive visual experiences using WebGL and CSS
- Pushing beyond the flat, into something alive
